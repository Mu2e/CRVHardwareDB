This version uses PyRoot as run on the mu2e environment.
Start by setting up the mu2e environment, then root:
$ setup mu2e
$ setup root

(The last setup can be tricky, on my machine running v2_04_00a,
the setup is:
$ setup root v6_06_08
)


To run this script: 
$ python SipmQueryRoot.py
Next select the range of Purchase orders to inspect by:
1) Entering the PO numbers in the "Sipm PO" window.  Note
    that multiple PO numbers may be selected by separating them
    with a comma (,).  For example: "PO-12345,PO-12346".  Then
    click the blue "Batches" button that selects the PO range.
or
2) By DOUBLE CLICKING each PO number displayed in the list box.
    After all PO numbers have been selected, click the blue
    batches button that selects the PO range.

Trend plots may be displayed by clicking the green "Scatter Plots"
  button.  A graphical ".png" output file is written to the logFiles
  subdirectory.

Histograms may be displayed by clicking the green "Histogram" button.
  A graphical ".png" output file and a root tree file is written 
  to the logFiles subdirectory.
