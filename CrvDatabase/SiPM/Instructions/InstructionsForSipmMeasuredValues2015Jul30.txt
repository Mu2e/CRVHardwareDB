This script is intended for entering
the locally measured valuesof
    bias voltage
    dark count
    gain
for 10% of the SiPM recieved.

1) Enter the worker barcode....
    press the 'Enter' button... 
    it turns "yellow"
      All worker barcodes start with the 
      prefix "wk-"
2) Enter the Institution
    press the 'Enter' button... 
    it turns "yellow"
3) Enter the workstation
    press the 'Enter' button... 
    it turns "yellow"
      All workstation barcodes start with
      the prefix "ws-"
4) Enter the SiPM number
    press the 'Enter' button... 
    it turns "yellow"
5) Enter the locally measured bais voltage,
      dark count and gain
    press the 'Enter' button... 
    it turns "yellow"
6) Press 'Enter Measurments' to enter values
    into the database...
    Afterwards all quantities
    that have to be re-entered will have their
    buttons cleared from the color "yellow"
    to the default color.

After the locally measured values are entered,
the vendor supplied values already in the
database will appear

The last ten SiPM Id's entered into the 
database may be viewed by clicking the 
"get database results" button

**  Note all worker barcodes and institutions
    must be entered in the database.. if yours
    is not present, contact a database administrator
