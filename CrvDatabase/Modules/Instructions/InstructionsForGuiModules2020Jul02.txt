This is a GUI-base script to enter the Module information.
The input is a comma-separated file (.cvs).

These files are found in a moduleSpreadSheets subdirectory.

Entering the module information into the database consist
of two parts:
  I) Enter the module layout
  II) Enter the CmbId, SmbId and SipmId information

Click the "Get Input File" button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open".  Note each 
"button" below uses different files.

I) ---------------  Enter the Module Layout ---------

1) Click the "Get Input File"  button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open". An example 
is in the subdirectory "moduleSpreadSheets2020May":
"moduleSpreadSheets2020May/crvmod-113_Layout-Sheet1.csv"

2) Click the "Enter Module Layout" button.  

II) -------- Enter the Module SmbId/CmbId/SipmId ---------

1) Click the "Get Input File"  button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open". An example 
is in the subdirectory "moduleSpreadSheets2020May":
"crvmod-113_SMBs-cmjChanged2020June02.csv"

2) Click the "Enter Module Smb/Cmb" button. 

III) -------- Enter the Module Test Values ---------

3)  There are no CRV Module test files, so this
option has not been implemented (as of 2020Jul02).  

----------------------- Control Features -----------

The "Turn on Test" button allows this script to run without
sending information to the database.

The "Turn on Debug" button turns on the debug statements that
are writen to stdin (i.e. the terminal window) that this
script was started.

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
