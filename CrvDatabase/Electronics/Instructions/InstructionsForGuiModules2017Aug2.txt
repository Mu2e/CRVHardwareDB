This is a GUI-base script to enter the Module information.
The input is a comma-separated file (.cvs).

That is found in the moduleSpreadSheets subdirectory.

Click the "Get Input File" button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open".  Note each 
"button" below uses different files.

1) Click the "Get Input File" button to select a file like:
"PPP2_Layout_cmjModified2017Aug2.csv"
Enter the initial diCounter information into the database:
click the 'Initial" button.  This enters the 
purchase order (batch) and the batch, which is obsolete as
all sipms are delivered at the same time.  This also enters
the vendor supplied measurements.

2)  Click the "Get Input File" button to select a file like:
"PPP2_Layout_TEST....csv"
After the modules are entered, click "Measurements" to enter
the locally measured values for those sipms measured into 
the database.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AS 2017AUG2.

The "Turn on Test" button allows this script to run without
sending information to the database.

The "Turn on Debug" button turns on the debug statements that
are writen to stdin (i.e. the terminal window) that this
script was started.

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
