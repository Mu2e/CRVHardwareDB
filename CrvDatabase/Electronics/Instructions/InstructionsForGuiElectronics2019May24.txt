This is a GUI-base script to enter the FEB (Electronics)
information.
The input is a comma-separated file (.cvs).

A sample file is found in the 
ElectronicsDataFiles subdirectory.

Click the "Get Input File" button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open".  Note each 
"button" below uses different files.

---- Enter the FEB --------------------

1) Click the "Get Input File" button to select a file like:
"FEB_Database_Sample_cmjModified2019May24.csv"
Click the desired input file and hit the "open" button

2) Click the green "Initial" button to load the FEB and
the FEB chips into the database.  This must be done first
as the measurement quantities require this information.
Exit (i.e. press the red "Quit") button.

---- Enter the FEB Test information --------------------

1) Click the "Get Input File" button to select a file like:
"FEB_Database_Sample_cmjModified2019May24.csv"
Click the desired input file and hit the "open" button

2) Click the green "Tests" button to load the FEB and
the FEB chips into the database.  This must be done first
as the measurement quantities require this information.
Exit (i.e. press the red "Quit") button.

------ Turn on options for testing ---------------------

The "Turn on Test" button allows this script to run without
sending information to the database.

The "Turn on Debug" button turns on the debug statements that
are writen to stdin (i.e. the terminal window) that this
script was started.

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
