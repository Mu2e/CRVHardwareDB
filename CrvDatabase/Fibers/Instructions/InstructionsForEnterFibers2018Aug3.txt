This is a GUI-base script to enter the Extrusion information
into the hardware database.
The input is a comma-separated file (.cvs).

1) Enter fiber number:
  a) Get Input File
     (open dialog appears) choose: 
      2018FiberSpreadSheets/180425 DATA sheet for UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.csv
  b) Click "Add Fibers"
  c) Exit script: "Quit"
2) Add some vendor measurements:
  a) Get Input File
     (open dialog appears) choose: 
      2018FiberSpreadSheets/180425 DATA sheet for UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.csv
  b) Click "Vendor Measurements"
  c) Exit script: "Quit"

3) Add some local diameter measurements:
  a) Get Input File
     (open dialog appears) choose: 
      2018FiberSpreadSheets/Fiber-QA-fiberdiameter-2018Jun13.csv
  b) Click "Vendor Measurements"
  c) Exit script: "Quit"


4) Add the spectral reponse: light yeild vs wavelength  measurements (this may be done more than once):
  a) Get Input File
     (open dialog appears) choose: 
      2018FiberSpreadSheets/Fiber-QA-spectrometer-2018Jun13.csv.csv
  b) Click "Local Spectral Measurements"
  c) Exit script: "Quit"

The "Turn on Test" button allows this script to run without
sending information to the database.

The "Turn on Debug" button turns on the debug statements that
are writen to stdin (i.e. the terminal window) that this
script was started.

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
