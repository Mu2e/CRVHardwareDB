This is a GUI-base script to enter the Extrusion information
into the hardware database.
The input is a comma-separated file (.cvs) generated from a 
spreadsheet such as the template:

QC-Mu2e-DB-060716-cmjModified2017May15.xlsx

The .cvs file is generated from the summary worksheet at 
the end.
That is found in the ExtrusionSpreadSheets subdirectory.

Click the "Get Input File" button to bring up the 
open file dialogn box.  Spool to the subdirectory
containing the ".cvs" file and click "open"

1) Enter the extrusion information into the database
by clicking the "Add Extrusions" button.

The "Turn on Test" button allows this script to run without
sending information to the database.

The "Turn on Debug" button turns on the debug statements that
are writen to stdin (i.e. the terminal window) that this
script was started.

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
