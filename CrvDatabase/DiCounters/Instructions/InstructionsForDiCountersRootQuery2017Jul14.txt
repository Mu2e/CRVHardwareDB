This version uses PyRoot as run on the mu2e environment.
Start by setting up the mu2e environment:
$ source /cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/products/common/etc/setups
$ setup mu2e
$ setup muse
$ muse setup

To run this script:
1) Click the Di-Counter button
2) Click the Histogram button.

A set of histograms with the dark current values for the Sipms
on the "a" side and "b" side when the scintillators are exposed 
to the light source.  Another set of histograms will appear with
SiPMs recorded when there is no light source.  At the end a root
file will appear with the current date.  The root file has two 
directories.  One for the SiPM readings with the light source,
the second with the SiPM readings without light source.  The root
files will be writen in the "outputFiles" directory...

The "Quit" button is self-explained!
